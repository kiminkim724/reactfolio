			description:
				"A legislative testimony project through Code for Boston! MAPLE makes it easy for residents to submit their testimony to the MA legislature and read the testimony of others. Our goals are to shine a light on the statehouse by 1) providing a public archive of legislative testimony; 2) standardizing and demystifying the testimony process, so that more people can make their voices heard; and 3) creating a space for constituents and legislators to maintain prolonged focus on key issues, and to learn more efficiently about the laws that will shape our lives. Through this, we hope that people can better channel their political energy into productive improvements for our local and state communities.",

The Tech Stack used was Typescript, React, MongoDB, TSOA.",

			title: "Marino Gym Tracker",
			description:
				"This project is a website that allows users to view how many people are in the gyms at Northeastern at different times of the day on average. I created this because I was frustrated not knowing when the gyms would be crowded or not. I first scraped the head count from the school's website and then uploaded the data to a MongoDB database, then used a Flask server to be able to get the data from the database and then calculate the averages and send it to the Next.js frontend",
